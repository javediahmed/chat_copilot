# browseGPT alpha
## First commit: 5/25/23
## Licence: Please cite if used
## Usage: python test.py
## Documentation: internal chat, help menu
## Status: dev, needs (<1hr of debug for NHI compliance)

# Notes
This module attempts to specify logic for NHI-compliant chatbot thumbprint and promptfilter. It was written entirely by droid which is unfortunate, because I didn't have that much time to finish debugging it. If you can fix the menu, it would be much appreciated. 

We have another project: browseGPT in development, if you are interested or have any comments, please email chat@aicanalytics.com

Thanks!

Issues:
## 1. Not technically NHI compliant due to human debugging
## 2. bot-ridden display logic
